# Exploratory Data Analysis:
1. Know what you're looking for
2. Prepare the dataset
3. Develop an intuition for the data using plots
	 - 3.1. Undrestand the DISTRIBUTIONS!
   - 3.2. Undrestand relathionships BETWEEN attributes
   
# Characterizing Distributions:
Numbers matter! all plots should be accompanied by quantification in a presentation or report
1. Start with basics such as mean and standard deviation
2. Use summary statistics to approximate your dataset
3. Analyze correlation/covariance (multivariate data) and one-dimentional statistics.

# Hypothesis Testing:
If two hypotheses are formulated, how confidantly can we point out the one that is true!
